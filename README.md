# Disneyland Reviews Analysis System

A Python-based data analysis application that processes and visualises customer reviews from Disneyland parks around the world.

This project was developed for the **QHO444 – Problem Solving Through Programming** module at Solent University.  
It demonstrates data processing, modular design, visualisation with Matplotlib, and Object-Oriented Programming principles.
